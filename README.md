# scribble
Node.js app that uses Express and Handlebars

This was my first app built using Node.js. On the front-end, a user types notes into a textarea and then saves their input. Upon saving input, the app uses Node's file system to write to a .txt file on the server. Later, when the user re-opens the app, the previously written notes are read from the .txt file and displayed in the textarea.
